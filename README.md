## What
Simple blackjack trainer as couldn't find anything useful online.

This follows basic blackjack strategy logic to help practice what you should do in any blackjack situation.

## How to use
Once started enter the amount of games you would like to play (integer)

Enter one of 'stand', 'hit', 'double', 'split', 'double_or_split' depending on the game situation

Round ends when you have made correct move (with no follow up) or have gone bust - but to go bust you will still need to follow the correct basic blackjack strategy!

## How to run
Have ruby installed

Clone the repo

Run `ruby play_game.rb` in the project root directory

Run `bundle exec rspec`

## Improvements to make
- Make double or split better (double or split rather than type both)
